## Azure Monitor Custom Metrics Output for Telegraf

This plugin will send custom metrics to Azure Monitor.
Azure Monitor has a metric resolution of one minute.
To handle this in Telegraf, the Azure Monitor output plugin will automatically aggregates metrics into one minute buckets, which are then sent to Azure Monitor on every flush interval.

The metrics from each input plugin will be written to a separate Azure Monitor namespace, prefixed with `Telegraf/` by default.
The field name for each metric is written as the Azure Monitor metric name.
All field values are written as a summarized set that includes: min, max, sum, count.
Tags are written as a dimension on each Azure Monitor metric.

Since Azure Monitor only accepts numeric values, string-typed fields are dropped by default.
There is a configuration option (`strings_as_dimensions`) to retain fields that contain strings as extra dimensions.
Azure Monitor allows a maximum of 10 dimensions per metric so any dimensions over that amount will be deterministically dropped.

## Azure Authentication

This plugin uses one of several different types of authenticate methods.
The preferred authentication methods are different from the *order* in which each authentication is checked.
Here are the preferred authentication methods:

1. Managed Service Identity (MSI) token
    - This is the prefered authentication method.
2. AAD Application Tokens (Service Principals)
    - Primarily useful if Telegraf is writing metrics for other resources. [More information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-objects).
    - A Service Principal or User Principal needs to be assigned the `Monitoring Contributor` roles.
3. AAD User Tokens (User Principals)
    - Allows Telegraf to authenticate like a user. It is best to use this method for development.

The plugin will attempt to authenticate with the first available of the following configurations in this order:

1. **Client Credentials**: Azure AD Application ID and Secret.

    Set the following Telegraf configuration variables:

    - `azure_tenant_id`: Specifies the Tenant to which to authenticate.
    - `azure_client_id`: Specifies the app client ID to use.
    - `azure_client_secret`: Specifies the app secret to use.

    Or set the following environment variables:

    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Specifies the Tenant to which to authenticate.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Specifies the app client ID to use.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Specifies the app secret to use.

2. **Client Certificate**: Azure AD Application ID and X.509 Certificate.

    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Specifies the Tenant to which to authenticate.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Specifies the app client ID to use.
    - `AZURE_CERTIFICATE_PATH`: Specifies the certificate Path to use.
    - `AZURE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: Specifies the certificate password to use.

3. **Resource Owner Password**: Azure AD User and Password. This grant type is *not
   recommended*, use device login instead if you need interactive login.

    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Specifies the Tenant to which to authenticate.
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Specifies the app client ID to use.
    - `AZURE_USERNAME`: Specifies the username to use.
    - `AZURE_PASSWORD`: Specifies the password to use.

4. **Azure Managed Service Identity**: Delegate credential management to the
   platform. Requires that code is running in Azure, e.g. on a VM. All
   configuration is handled by Azure. See [Azure Managed Service
   Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/msi-overview)
   for more details. Only available on ARM-based resources.

**Note: As shown above, the last option (#5) is the preferred way to
authenticate when running Telegraf on Azure VMs. The VMs will need to be given
access to the Azure Monitor to publish custom metrics. Instructions on how to
grant access can be found [here]()**

## Config

The plugin will automatically attempt to discover the region and resource ID using the Azure VM Instance Metadata service.
If Telegraf is not running on a virtual machine or the VM Instance Metadata service is not available, the following variables are required for the output to function.

* region
* resourceId

### Configuration:

```
## See the [Azure Monitor output plugin README](/plugins/outputs/azure_monitor/README.md)
## for details on authentication options.

## Write HTTP timeout, formatted as a string. Defaults to 20s.
#timeout = "20s"

## Set the namespace prefix, defaults to "Telegraf/<input-name>".
#namespace_prefix = "Telegraf/"

## Azure Monitor doesn't have a string value type, so convert string
## fields to dimensions (a.k.a. tags) if enabled. Azure Monitor allows
## a maximum of 10 dimensions so Telegraf will only send the first 10
## alphanumeric dimensions.
#strings_as_dimensions = false

## *The following two fields must be set or be available via the
## Instance Metadata service on Azure Virtual Machines.*

## Azure Region to publish metrics against, e.g. eastus, southcentralus.
#region = ""

## The Azure Resource ID against which metric will be logged, e.g.
## "/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/<vm_name>"
#resource_id = ""
```
